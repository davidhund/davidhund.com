<p class="intro">It seems 2004 called and wanted its blog back</p>

I have blogged before, but mostly on personal stuff. After years of commenting on other people's articles, [blabbing on Twitter](http://valuedstandards.com) and creating [one-off pages with technical experiments](http://valuedstandards.com/static/test/) I've decided to start blogging again.

Posts here will mostly be on [front-end web development](http://valuedstandards.com). But no guarantees :)

The first thing one needs, I've found, when starting blogging is an online _weblog_. No surprise there. I could easily have started with one of those fancy services with big header images, but stubborn as I am I've decided to build it myself. This is why, at the moment, you are looking at an unfinished mess of a site…

The upside is that I can do with it whatever I want, however I want it and document the process.

I would love to hear your thoughts so—in the absence of comments—[reply on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@valuedstandards%20your%20blog%20sucks!) or [submit an issue on Github](https://github.com/davidhund/davidhund.com/issues)
