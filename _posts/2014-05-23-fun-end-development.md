title: Fun-End Development
category: front-end
---

Front-end development is booming. I have been doing this for a long time and never was it so much fun as these days. Front-end specialists are in high demand, browsers are updating quite rapidly and stumbling over each other to support the latest goodies.

Then there is an *explosion* of tools. Sure: this is a challenge also. We all have a hard time keeping up. But does anyone remember the time where we had to include all these crappy `.htc` behaviours and ugly scripts to support *rounded borders*? Anyone?!

I, for one, am very happy to be working on the front-end.

I would love to hear your thoughts so—in the absence of comments—[reply on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@valuedstandards%20front-end%20development%20blog%20sucks!) or [submit an issue on Github](https://github.com/davidhund/davidhund.com/issues)
