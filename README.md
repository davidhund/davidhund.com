This is—or rather will be— my personal weblog with articles related to front-end Web development.

For way too long I've felt the urge to blog, but could not because I did not have a weblog :(
Being too perfectionistic (and lazy?) my mythical super-weblog never materialized.

No longer!

It will be far from perfect. But it will be a blog…
